Great start with the Q-learning implementation! I see that you're using a graph structure and updating the Q-table based on state transitions. There are a few things we can look into to avoid potential looping issues and improve stability in the algorithm.

### Potential Issues and Improvements

1. **Handling Terminal State (Goal)**:
    - Make sure there's a termination condition in the `find_path` method when the agent reaches the goal. If there’s no direct termination, the agent may continue to loop through states.
    ```python
    if current_state == goal:
        break
    ```

2. **Action Selection (`choose_action` Method)**:
    - In the `choose_action` method, you’re using `np.argmax` to select the action with the highest Q-value. Make sure that there’s always at least one valid action available, and that you're handling tie cases (i.e., multiple actions have the same Q-value).
    ```python
    q_values = [self.get_q_value(state, action) for action in self.graph.neighbors(state)]
    if np.all(np.array(q_values) == 0):
        # Randomly explore if all Q-values are 0 (initial case)
        return np.random.choice(list(self.graph.neighbors(state)))
    return list(self.graph.neighbors(state))[np.argmax(q_values)]
    ```

3. **Exploration Rate Decay**:
    - You could decay the **exploration rate** (epsilon-greedy policy) over time to encourage more exploitation (selecting the best known action) after some exploration early on.
    ```python
    self.exploration_rate = max(self.exploration_rate * 0.99, 0.01)
    ```

4. **State-Action Rewards**:
    - The reward function should make sure it encourages the agent to move toward the goal. In your case, you’re assigning negative rewards based on the cost between states, which is good, but ensure that there’s a good **incentive** (e.g., a larger reward) for reaching the goal, to help prevent the agent from looping through intermediate states.

### Enhancements for Q-learning Implementation

1. **Add a Loop Counter in `find_path`**:
    - Add a **loop counter** or a max number of steps per episode to prevent the agent from getting stuck indefinitely.
    ```python
    def find_path(self, start, goal, max_steps=1000):
        current_state = start
        path = [current_state]
        steps = 0

        while current_state != goal and steps < max_steps:
            action = self.choose_action(current_state)
            next_state = action
            reward = -self.graph.cost(current_state, next_state)
            self.update_q_value(current_state, action, reward, next_state)
            current_state = next_state
            path.append(current_state)
            steps += 1

        if steps >= max_steps:
            print("Reached max steps, pathfinding stopped.")
        
        return path
    ```

2. **Verbose Logging for Debugging**:
    - Add some logging or print statements to help trace what the agent is doing at each step:
    ```python
    print(f"Current State: {current_state}, Action: {action}, Next State: {next_state}, Reward: {reward}")
    ```

### Final Code with Improvements

```python
import numpy as np

class QLearning:
    def __init__(self, graph, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.9, exploration_rate=0.1):
        self.graph = graph
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.discount_factor = discount_factor
        self.exploration_rate = exploration_rate
        self.q_table = {}

    def get_q_value(self, state, action):
        return self.q_table.get((state, action), 0.0)

    def update_q_value(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        current_q = self.get_q_value(state, action)
        max_next_q = max([self.get_q_value(next_state, a) for a in self.graph.neighbors(next_state)])
        new_q = current_q + self.learning_rate * (reward + self.discount_factor * max_next_q - current_q)
        self.q_table[(state, action)] = new_q

    def choose_action(self, state):
        # Epsilon-greedy policy
        if np.random.random() < self.exploration_rate:
            return np.random.choice(list(self.graph.neighbors(state)))
        else:
            q_values = [self.get_q_value(state, action) for action in self.graph.neighbors(state)]
            if np.all(np.array(q_values) == 0):
                return np.random.choice(list(self.graph.neighbors(state)))  # Random exploration if all Q-values are 0
            return list(self.graph.neighbors(state))[np.argmax(q_values)]

    def find_path(self, start, goal, max_steps=1000):
        current_state = start
        path = [current_state]
        steps = 0

        while current_state != goal and steps < max_steps:
            action = self.choose_action(current_state)
            next_state = action
            reward = -self.graph.cost(current_state, next_state)
            self.update_q_value(current_state, action, reward, next_state)
            current_state = next_state
            path.append(current_state)
            steps += 1
            print(f"Step {steps}: State={current_state}, Action={action}, Reward={reward}")

        if steps >= max_steps:
            print("Reached max steps, stopping pathfinding.")
        
        return path
```

This should help prevent looping and improve the overall learning stability. Let me know how it goes after running these adjustments!
